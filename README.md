## Synthesizer Instructions
1. Upload MP3 File:
Click on the "load file" button.
Select the MP3 file you want to upload from your device.
If the button turns green it indicates that the MP3 file has been successfully uploaded.
2. Generate Plot:
Click on the button to generate the plot.
You have the option to choose between a plot in the time domain or the frequency domain. Use the appropriate button to select your preference.
3. Modify Volume:
Use the drag bar to adjust the volume of the original MP3 file.
Drag the bar to the right to increase the volume and to the left to decrease it.
4. Implement Time Wrap:
Use the slider bar to introduce a time delay into the audio.
Drag the bar to specify the amount of time wrap you want to apply to the audio.
5. Change Noise:
Adjust the spinner or simply type on it to set the desired noise level:
“0” represents no noise
“1” or more represents more added noise to the audio file
6. Change Speed:
Adjust the spinner or simply type on it to set the desired speed:
"1" represents normal speed.
"2" represents double speed.
"0.5" represents half the speed. 
7. Filter
Change the filter by click the drop down menu and selecting the ideal filter
“Band Pass” selects the Band Pass Filter
“High Pass” selects a High Pass Filter
“Low Pass” selects a Low Pass Filter
“Band Reject” selects a Band Reject Filter
8. Generate Modified MP3:
Once you're satisfied with the modifications (volume adjustment, time delay, speed), proceed to generate the modified/desired MP3.
Click on the appropriate button to initiate the generation process.
Be aware that generating the modified MP3 may take some time, depending on the complexity of the modifications and the size of the audio.
Modified graphs will be time-shifted (if any) and scaled (if any).
9. State of Audio:
Initially, the state of the audio will be ‘original’, but once modifications are made it will be modified and the button will change to say ‘modified’.
If you want to return to the original state you can press the button to switch to the ‘original’ audio.
To plot the original audio press the ‘Generate Audio Plot’ and to play it press ‘Play Unfiltered Sound’.
10. Play Modified MP3: 
Once the modified MP3 has been generated, you can play it to hear the changes you made.
Ensure that your device's audio is enabled and the volume is adjusted appropriately before playing the modified MP3.
11. Save Modified MP3:
If you're satisfied with the modifications and wish to keep the modified MP3 click ‘Save Modified Audio to File’ to save it on your device.
